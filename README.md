# Data Visualization Projects
Welcome to my Data Visualization repository! This folder contains two projects that showcase my ability to analyze and visualize data to uncover insights, identify patterns, and support business decision-making.

# Project 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Mobile Usage Patterns
## üìå Project Scope
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in any business analytics project. A well-designed EDA can reveal data quality issues, highlight unexpected relationships, and generate valuable business insights.

In this project, I conducted an EDA on a dataset containing 700 samples of mobile usage data, including metrics such as:

- App usage time
- Screen-on time
- Battery drain
- Data consumption

Each sample is classified into five user behavior categories (from light to extreme usage). My goal was to create three visualizations that emphasize: (1) Data quality issues or dataset weaknesses (2) Key insights emerging from the EDA (3) Business implications of the findings

# Project 2: Analyzing the Diffusion of EO50 Certificates in NYC
## üìå Project Scope
This project examines data from the Industrial and Commercial Abatement Program (ICAP), which includes businesses that have complied with Equal Employment Opportunity (EO50) requirements in NYC.

Dataset Overview:

>992 businesses that received EO50 certificates

>16 variables, including approval timestamps and location data

For this project, I created two visualizations that analyze:

>(1) The trend of EO50 approvals over time

>(2)The geographical distribution of EO50 certificates across NYC

To enhance the analysis, I integrated Crime Data to explore potential socio-economic influences on EO50 certification diffusion.
