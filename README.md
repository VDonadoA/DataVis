1. Project Scope
   
Carrying out a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) is vital for any business analytics project. A well designed and executed EDA can help us spot data quality issues, isolate unexpected relationships, and even generate important insights about the business problem at hand.
Choose the dataset and produce three plots that emphasize:

  •  Quality issues, intrinsic weaknesses, or idiosyncratic aspects of the chosen dataset
  
  • The novelty and insights emerging from your EDA
  
  • The implications of your EDA for the analysis of a business phenomenon
